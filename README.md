# Monte-Carlo-Simulation

## About the Project
The Monte-Carlo-Simulation is an educational project designed to demonstrate the power and application of Monte Carlo methods in financial analysis. This project particularly focuses on running simulations based on gold price datasets to predict price movements and understand the dynamics of financial markets.

## Dataset
The simulation uses GOLDAMGBD228NLBM.csv as its primary dataset. This dataset includes historical gold prices and is critical for understanding market trends and making predictions.

## Technical Requirements
The project is developed in Java. Ensure you have the latest version of Java installed on your system to run the simulation.

## Installation
No specific installation process is required for this project. Simply download the project files to your local system.

## Usage
To run the simulation:

 - Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
 - Open the command line interface and navigate to the directory containing the Monte_Carlo_Simulation.java file.
 - Compile the Java file using javac Monte_Carlo_Simulation.java (assuming Java is installed and configured correctly).
 - Run the simulation using java Monte_Carlo_Simulation.

## Output
The simulation generates a visualization of the price movement of gold using the Monte Carlo method. This visualization helps in understanding the potential future price trajectories based on historical data.
